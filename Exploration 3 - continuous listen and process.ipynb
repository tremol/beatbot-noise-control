    "Right now, this doesn't perform very well. The processing is quite slow, and the recognition doesn't seem very good, despite the excellent (95%) testing performance the model displayed when we first built it. The spectrogram calculation seems to be the biggest single time sink (at least in the get_prediction function), but only one third of the total time. We end up with a lot of input overflow errors also, because the callback function takes so long that it can't keep up with the rate of audio input.\n",
